/*Dependencies and Imports: The code starts by importing necessary modules like Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB integration), Article model (representing articles in the database), article router (for handling article-related routes), and method-override (for HTTP method overriding).

Express App Setup: It initializes an Express application instance.

Port Configuration: It sets up the port number for the server. It defaults to port 5000 but can be overridden by an environment variable.

MongoDB Connection: It connects to a MongoDB database named 'your-database' running on the local machine at port 27017.

View Engine Configuration: It sets the view engine to EJS (Embedded JavaScript), enabling dynamic HTML rendering.

Middleware Setup: It configures middleware:

express.urlencoded: Parses incoming request bodies with URL-encoded payloads.
methodOverride: Allows overriding of HTTP methods using a query value or header.
Route Handling:

It defines a route for handling GET requests to the root URL ('/'). When a request is made to this URL, it fetches articles from the database and renders them using the 'index' view.
It uses the article router for handling requests starting with '/articles'. This delegates the handling of article-related routes to the article router.
Server Initialization: It starts the server and listens on the specified port. Upon successful start, it logs a message indicating the server is running and on which port.

Overall, this code sets up a basic Express.js server with MongoDB integration, providing functionality to handle article-related operations.*/
